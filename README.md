In questions.py
 we'll create a question class to represent each question in the game.
 Each question will have a prompt and a set of possible answers,
 and one of them will be correct.'''

 Then we'll create a module called questions to store it
 of questions to be used in the game list.

How to play the game:
 we run the `game_start.py` file. An informational message with game instructions
 and possible user choices will appear on the terminal. If the user enters a choice
  that is not in the list of choices, he will be asked to enter a choice from the 
  suggested options, and the question will be returned for repetition. 1 point is 
  given for each answered question. At the end of the game, points are counted based
   on how many readings were answered correctly and how many questions were incorrect.

Advice:
 There are 41 questions in this game. In order to have more questions, you need to 
 add the list of the 31st line in the `questions.py` file
